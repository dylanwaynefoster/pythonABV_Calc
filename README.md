# pythonABV_Calc

This is just a simple script written in Python to check Alcohol by Volume when brewing beer. I have a Java version, but I just wanted something to easily run from the command line without having to fire up my previous Java version.

This is meant for quick, personal use so there is not a lot going on. I want to practice more Python and also practice using Vim. I plan on writing everything in Vim now just to get my chops up.

Thanks for checking it out!
